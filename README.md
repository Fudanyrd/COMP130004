# What this is
    My solution to Proj of COMP130004.

# Disclaimer
    It is a really, really bad idea to post it on github publicly.
    Although some of you may don't think so.

    If you seek to copy code snippets from this project, 
    please display prominently that "it is NOT my own work" 
    in case all of us get into plagiarism inspection.

    Also, it is guaranteed that my solution will be correct but NOT
    optimal. You are free to modify the methods I wrote.

# Bug Report
Here is a screen shot of my output using original "sample.txt".

I would appreciate it if you a) notice something wrong with it and b) can send me a bug report.
